This code archive accompanies the paper: 'Finding diagnostically useful patterns in quantitative phenotypic data' by Aitken, FitzPatrick et al. American Journal of Human Genetics (2019)
The archive includes implementations of the methods in two languages:
 1. Code in R implementing unsupervised naive Bayes clustering is provided in ISS/R_code;
 2. Code in Java implementing unsupervised naive Bayes clustering is provided in ISS/Java;
Both sets of files provide the clustering algorithm and demo examples running it. 
The Java code is considerably faster and was used in the large scale analyses reported in the paper.
